            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef
            <li>½ cup minced onion
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
            <li>½ cup water
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
            <li>12 lasagna noodles
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese
            <li>1 egg
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</ol>
